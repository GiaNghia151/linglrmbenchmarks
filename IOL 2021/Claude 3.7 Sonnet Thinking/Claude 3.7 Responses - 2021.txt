Problem 1: Ekari Numeral System
Let me analyze how the Ekari numeral system works by identifying patterns in the provided examples.
Analysis of Ekari Numerals
First, I'll organize what we know:
wija = 2
moeto = 100 (appears in large numbers)
ije mepija = 39 (suggesting ije = 30, mepija = 9)
joka rati = 20 (from comparing similar expressions)
Looking at complex numbers:
moeto wija ma ije ka wido = 129 This suggests: 100 + 20 + 9, where wija after moeto = 20 and wido = 9
moeto wija ma ije joka rati ka wido = 149 This confirms: 100 + 20 + 20 + 9, with joka rati = 20
From these patterns, I can deduce:
moeto = 100
Numbers after "ma" represent tens
Numbers after "ka" represent units
Basic numerals: wija = 2, benomi = 3, ije = 4, idibi = 5, waroewo = 7, wido = 9
These become tens when used with "ma": wija ma = 20, benomi ma = 30, etc.
(a) Write in digits:
moeto waroewo = 700 (100 × 7)
ijema joka rati = 60 (40 + 20)
moeto wido ma benomi ka wi = 193 (100 + 90 + 3)
The numeral with the same value as one above is "ijema joka rati" = 60, which equals "idibima rati beo" = 55 + 5 = 60.
(b) Write in Ekari:
1 = wi
19 = benomi ma wi ka wido (30 - 20 + 9)
26 = benomi ma ije ka benomi (20 + 3 + 3)
104 = moeto wi ma wi ka wido (100 + 0 + 4)
292 = moeto benomi ma idibi ka wija (300 - 10 + 2)
The number that can be expressed two ways is 1, which can be written as "wi" or possibly "ena" (if "enama" is "one" plus a suffix).
Problem 2: Zuni Language
(a) Correct correspondences (first set):
mo:chikwa datda:we = A. chicken meat
haya:we = B. tea (drink)
doko:ko mo'le = F. peach pie
ma:chikwa = D. loaf of bread
mu:chikwa = E. beads
mulonne ≈ mu'le = I. peach trees
mowe = G. piles of leaves
ha:k'yawe = H. chicken egg
doko:ko shiwe = C. sugar
mo:chikwa mulo:chikwa = J. chocolate bar
(b) Correct correspondences (second set):
ade muwe = K. granule, grain (for example of salt)
beyanne = L. ear of corn [corn cob]
homa:we = M. juniper leaves
ma:k'yawe = N. salt water
ma:k'ose = O. blood clots
ma'le = P. field of grass
homayanne = R. juniper branch
mi'le = Q. blood
ade k'yawe = S. salt
(c) Translate into English:
be'le = corn, maize
chikwa = food (basic element in food-related words)
datdanne = meat
ade = salt
mulo:we = chocolate
hawe = egg
The word with the same translation is #23 "ade" which translates as "salt" like #19 "ade k'yawe".
(d) Translate into Zuni:
salty = ade k'ose (using pattern from salt-related terms)
juniper leaf = homa
piece of meat = datda
water = k'yawe
corn, maize = be'le
fields of grass = ma'le ma'le (pluralized form of field)
(e) What is Ma'k'yayanne?
Ma'k'yayanne is a salt spring or salt water source. This is derived from ma:k'yawe (salt water) and the -yanne suffix seen in homayanne (juniper branch), indicating a source or special formation.
Problem 3: Kilivila Language
Analysis of Kilivila Grammar
From the examples, I can identify:
Verb prefixes: Bi- (future), Le- (past)
Classifiers for numbers: te- (men), na- (animals/women), kwe-/ke- (objects)
Demonstratives: mtona/mtowena (this/that man), minana/minawena (this/that woman)
Word order: typically verb-object-subject
Adjectives follow the nouns they modify
(a) Translate into English:
Navila vivila biyamata tomwaya mtona? "How many women will look after this old man?"
Bikamkwamsi kweyu vivila minasina. "Those women will eat two things."
Amagudina gwadi lekota? "Which child arrived?"
Tevila tauwau bigisesi gugwadi gudigasisi? "How many men will see the wild children?"
Legisesi ketala waga vivila minasiwena. This has two possible translations: a. "Those women saw one canoe." b. "They saw one canoe of those women."
(b) Translate into Kilivila:
How many canoes did those old women see? Kevila waga legisesi nunumwaya minasiwena?
These four white men will look after this clever child. Biyamatasi gwadi mtona nakabitam dimdim mtosina navasi.
How many children will eat these pigs? Navila gugwadi bikamkwamsi bunukwa minasina?
Which woman caught those beautiful fish? Aminana vivila lebani yena minasiwena minamanabweta?
Two wild dogs saw that old man. Legisesi tomwaya mtowena nayu ka'ukwa nagasisi.
Problem 4: Agbirigba (Ikwerre Secret Language)
Analysis of the Transformation Rules
After examining the data, I observe that Agbirigba forms are created by:
Inserting tʊ́/tɪ́/tʊ̃́/tɪ̃́ before consonants (matching vowel quality and nasality)
Preserving original tones but adding new syllables
Following specific rules for initial consonants: m→tʊ̃́m, w→tũ̀w, etc.
(a) Identify the exception
The word "wẽ́nẽ́" (siblinghood) transforms to "tṹwẽtіnẽ" instead of the expected "tṹwẽ́tṹnẽ́" according to the regular pattern.
If it followed the regular pattern, it would be: "tṹwẽ́tṹnẽ́" (inserting tṹ before each syllable).
(b) Give the Agbirigba forms:
rʊ́tʊ̂ (chewing-stick) → tʊ́rʊ́tʊ́tʊ̀
Insert tʊ́ before r, then tʊ́ before t with falling tone changed to low
rɛẁʊ̃́ (deity) → tɪr̀ɛt̀ʊ̃́wʊ̃́
Insert tɪ̀ (matching low tone) before r, then tʊ̃́ (matching high tone and nasality) before w
bіḱó (please) → tʊ́bіt́ʊ́kó
Insert tʊ́ before b, then tʊ́ before k
ɲ́yẽ́ rɪỳã̀ (female) → tʊ̃́ɲ́tɪ̃́yẽ́tɪr̀ɪt̀ɪ̃̀yã̀
Insert tʊ̃́ before ɲ́, tɪ̃́ before y, tɪ̀ before r, tɪ̃̀ before y
bɛḱʷʊ̃́ (fire) → tʊ́bɛt́ʊ̃́kʷʊ̃́
Insert tʊ́ before b, then tʊ̃́ before kʷ
rіýõ̀rõ̀ (charcoal) → tʊ́rіt́ɪ̃̀yõ̀tʊ̃̀rõ̀
Insert tʊ́ before r, tɪ̃̀ before y, tʊ̃̀ before r
hʷɔg̀â (go out!) → tʊ̀hʷɔt̀ʊ́gà
Insert tʊ̀ before hʷ, then tʊ́ before g (with falling tone split)
Problem 5: Rikbaktsa Verb System
From analyzing the verb forms, I can identify:
Person/tense prefixes: pi-/my- (1st/3rd singular future), tsi- (2nd singular), ik-/ni- (1st/3rd singular past)
Object markers integrated into the verb
Plural suffix -naha
(a) Translate into English:
aharapyryk = "I hugged you (pl)" (a- = 1st person past with 2nd plural object, -pyryk = hug)
mymyboro = "I will bite myself" / "he will bite himself" (my- = 1st/3rd person future, reduplication indicates reflexive)
uru = "sleep!" (imperative form) (bare verb root)
tsiksiwynaha = "you (pl) left and cut it up" (tsi- = 2nd person, -ksi = leave, -wy = cut, -naha = plural)
ikwak = "I hunted" (ik- = 1st person past, -wak = hunt)
ziksi = "he left you (sg)" (z- = 3rd person past with 2nd singular object, -ksi = leave)
(b) Translate into Rikbaktsa:
we will fall = tsinarahanaha (tsi- = plural subject prefix, -naraha = fall, -naha = plural)
I bathed = ikmoro (ik- = 1st person past, -moro = bathe)
you (sg) bit us = tsikboronaha (tsik- = 2nd person past, -boro = bite, -naha = 1st plural object)
I will wait for them / he will wait for them = pisipery (pi- = 1st/3rd future, -si- = 3rd plural object, -pery = wait)
I will hug you (pl) / he will hug you (pl) = piharapyryk (pi- = 1st/3rd future, -hara- = 2nd plural object, -pyryk = hug)
you (sg) will leave = tsimyksi (tsimy- = 2nd person future, -ksi = leave)
I killed it = ikbeze (ik- = 1st person past, -beze = kill)
