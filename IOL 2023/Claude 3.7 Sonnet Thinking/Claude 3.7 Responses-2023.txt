Problem 1: Guazacapán Xinka
Part (a): Filling in gaps for rows 15-18
To solve this problem, I need to identify patterns in how Form 1 and Form 2 relate to each other.
Key patterns observed:
Form 2 begins with ɨn-, ɨm-, or ɨŋ- prefix (nasalization matching the place of articulation of the first consonant)
There's often metathesis (rearrangement of sounds) and consonant changes
The final y' in Form 1 transforms in a consistent way in Form 2
Applying these patterns:
netkay' → ɨnneteka'
kɨrɨy' → ɨŋkɨr'ɨ
p'uhruy' → ɨmp'uhur'u
her'oy → ɨnher'o
Part (b): Filling in gaps in rows 39-48
Analyzing patterns from the additional verb forms reveals:
Forms with final -ŋ/n' indicate "I (did something)"
Forms starting with ɨm-/ɨn- + ending in -iʔ indicate "I was/am being (done to)"
Forms starting with a- indicate "it was/is being (done to)"
Completing the gaps:
her'oŋ → I smoothed out (it)
ɨniʂpaʔ → I leave
aplaʔ → it was opened/it is being opened
? → "it chose (it)" → aʂur'oʔ
? → "I saw (it)" → piriŋ
? → "I plant (it)" → ʂawʂaŋ
? → "it was trapped" → ak'anaʔ
? → "I leap" → ɨnp'ɨhnaʔ
? → "it is being sewn, woven" → ahɨk'aʔ
? → "I was bathed" → ɨnipaliʔ
Problem 2: Apurinã
Part (a): Translation into English
uwa xinhikaru sytu → He/she remembered the woman.
txipary nhinhikary → He/she ate the banana.
kyky aikute pysykary ywamukary → The man gave the house to him.
Part (b): Explaining the grammatical error
uwa umynary kanawa ximakymukary
This sentence is grammatically incorrect because object nouns must carry the suffix -te/-txi. The direct object "kanawa" (canoe) is missing this required object marker.
Corrected version: uwa umynary kanawate ximakymukary Translation: He/she brought the canoe to the fish.
Part (c): Translation into Apurinã in two ways
You_{sg} found the house.
pita apukary aikute
aikute pita apukary
