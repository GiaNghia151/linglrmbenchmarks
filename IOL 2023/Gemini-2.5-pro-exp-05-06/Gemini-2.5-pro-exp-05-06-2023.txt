Linguistic Rules for Guazacapán Xinka:

    Form 1 to Form 2 Transformation:

        Prefix ɨN-: N assimilates place of articulation to the following consonant (m before labials, ŋ before velars, n elsewhere).

        Initial Consonant Voicing: Non-ejective stops (p, t, k) become voiced (b, d, ɡ) after the nasal prefix. Other consonants (ejectives, fricatives, nasals, etc.) are not affected.

        Stem Modification: The final -(V)y' of Form 1 is removed. The core stem is modified.

            Epenthesis: A vowel is often inserted into consonant clusters or to fit a morphological template. This vowel is frequently a (e.g., apl- -> apal-; tund- -> dunat-), or it can harmonize with a preceding stem vowel (e.g., ɬɨkn- -> ɬɨkɨn-; yuɬm- -> yuɬum-).

            Consonant alternation: ʂ may change to ʦ in some roots (e.g., kiʂ- -> giʦ-; ʂakʂ- -> ʂakaʦ-).

        Suffixation: The vowel that immediately preceded -y' in Form 1 becomes the final vowel of Form 2, typically following a glottal stop ' which is realized on the preceding consonant (e.g., piriy' -> ɨmbir'i).

    Other Verb Forms (Table 2 morphology):

        Stems: Verbs generally use a "Form 1-like stem" (Form 1 root minus the final y') or a "Form 2-like stem" (Form 2 root, without its prefix and final vowel inflection).

        "I Xed (it)" (active past/perfective): Form 1-like stem + suffix (-ŋ after stem vowels a, o, u; -n' after stem vowels i, e, ɨ). No prefix.

        "I was Xed" (past passive): ɨN- prefix + Form 1-like stem + Vowel Lengthening (e.g., i->ii, e/o->ee/oo, thematic a->aa) + -ʔ suffix.

        "I am being Xed" (present passive) / "I X" (intransitive present/past): ɨN- prefix + Form 1-like stem (or a variant) + -ʔ suffix. Vowel lengthening is generally absent in present passives. Some intransitives might show vowel length.

        "it was Xed" (past passive) / "it Xed" (intransitive past): Form 1-like stem + -ʔ suffix. Some stems exhibit vowel lengthening in this form (e.g., root e/o->ee/oo, root a->aa).

        "it is being Xed" (present passive) / "it Xes" (intransitive present): a- prefix + Form 1-like stem + -ʔ suffix.

Problem 2: Apurinã

(a) Translate into English:
17. uwa xinhikaru sytu - The woman remembered her.
18. txipary nhinhikary - I ate the banana.
19. kyky aikute pysykary ywamukary - You (sg) gave the house to the man. (with "the man" clarifying "to him")

(b) This sentence is grammatically incorrect. Explain why, and provide its grammatically correct equivalent and its English translation:
20. uwa umynary kanawa ximakymukary
* Reason for incorrectness: Redundant subject marking. The independent subject pronoun uwa (she) co-occurs with the 3rd person singular subject prefix u- on the verb umynary. Typically, one or the other is used.
* Grammatically correct equivalent (either):
* uwa mynary kanawa ximakymukary
* umynary kanawa ximakymukary
* English translation: She brought the canoe to the fish.

(c) Translate into Apurinã in two ways (demonstrating word order flexibility):
21. You_{sg} found the house.
* 1. pita aikute piapukary
* 2. pita piapukary aikute
22. I brought your_{sg} canoe to the girl.
* 1. nuta nmynary pisykaru hãtakurumukary
* 2. nuta pisykaru nmynary hãtakurumukary
23. He brought your_{sg} water to me.
* 1. ywa mynary piãtary nutamukary
* 2. umynary piãtary nutamukary
24. The man drank the girl’s blood.
* 1. kyky ĩpurãã hãtakuru herẽka
* 2. hãtakuru herẽka ĩpurãã kyky
25. I remembered the eye.
* 1. nuta nxinhikary uky
* 2. uky nxinhikary nuta
26. You_{sg} ate my banana.
* 1. pita pinhikary ntxipary
* 2. ntxipary pinhikary pita

Linguistic Rules for Apurinã:

    Word Order: Relatively free (SOV, SVO, OSV, etc., are attested). Dative arguments (-mukary) often follow the verb or direct object.

    Subject Marking:

        Independent Pronouns: nuta (I), pita (you sg), ywa (he/she).

        Verb Prefixes: n(h)-/ny- (I), pi-/py- (you sg), u-/y-/i- (he/she/it; allomorphs may be verb-specific or indicate noun class).

        If an overt NP or subject pronoun (like ywa) is present, the verb may lack a subject prefix. If the subject is pronominal and not overtly stated, a verb prefix is common. Co-occurrence of an independent subject pronoun and its corresponding subject prefix on the verb is often ungrammatical or redundant.

    Possession:

        Noun-Noun: Possessor Noun + Possessed Noun (e.g., sytu apy "woman’s bone").

        Possessive Prefixes on Nouns: n(h)-/ny- (my), pi-/py- (your sg), u-/y-/i- (his/her/its, similar to verb subject prefixes).

    Noun Morphology: Some nouns take suffixes like -te or -txi (function not fully determined, possibly definiteness or noun class).

    Case Marking: The suffix -mukary indicates dative ("to") or allative ("towards").

    Verb Stems: Can show minor variations for tense/aspect or transitivity (e.g., mynaru/mynary/mynanu "bring").

19. ba-ihwin - You_{pl} really cried.
20. nambum-kisaɣah - Oh, I [VERB-kis]ed in vain.
21. bat-ɣadawn - Aw, he/she left you_{sg} behind.
22. ubamum-kolewn - Oh, you_{sg} [VERB-kol]ed him in vain.

(b) Translate into Coastal Marind:
23. He floated to the surface. - a-tamanab
24. Aw, you_{sg} returned. - ubat-dahetok
25. Oh, I silenced him! - nambam-hoɣeb
26. He really chased us away. - abe-otnawn
27. You_{pl} really spat on us in vain. - ebeum-kesnawn

Linguistic Rules for Coastal Marind:

    Verb Structure: Verbs are bipartite: PrefixComplex - VerbRoot+Suffix.

    Prefix Complex: Composed of SubjectMarker (+MoodMarker1)(+MoodMarker2).

        Subject Markers (Transitive Paradigm):

            1sg: n- (e.g., nakum-, nambat-)

            2sg: o- (allomorph u- before /b/ initial mood markers) (e.g., ob-, ubate-)

            3sg: a- (or Ø- if followed by a mood marker like um-) (e.g., a-isanab, um-kulaɣawn)

            1pl: nak(e)- or nam(be)- (allomorphy with mood markers) (e.g., nake-, nambe-)

            2pl: e- or i- (allomorphy with mood markers) (e.g., e-keseh, ibatum-)

        Mood/Aspect/Evidential Markers (can combine):

            -(m)bat-: 'Aw' (evidential/affective).

            -(m)bam-: 'Oh!' (emphatic/surprise).

            -be-: 'really' (intensifier).

            -(k)um-: 'in vain' (frustrative).

    Object Suffixes (on Verb Root):

        1sgO (me): -nab

        2sgO (you sg): -awn

        3sgO (him/her/it): -eh, -eb, -ewn (allomorphs depending on verb root/tense).

        1plO (us): -nawn

        2plO (you pl): -ab

    Intransitive Verbs (items 14-17):

        Subject marking appears distinct or fused with mood markers.

            1sgS: e.g., bam-ɣuyanah (Oh, I shuddered!) where bam- likely -(m)bam- (Oh!) + 1sgS.

            2sgS: e.g., a-ɣuyaɣah (You_{sg} shuddered.).

            1plS: e.g., bate-tamanab (Aw, we floated.) where bate- likely -(m)bat- (Aw) + 1plS.

            2plS: e.g., ba-tamab (You_{pl} really floated.) where ba- likely -be- (really) + 2plS.

        Suffixes like -ɣah, -nah, -ab mark tense/aspect or intransitive verb classes.

Problem 4: Plains Cree

(a) Translate into English:
22. ē-wāpamikoyēk - as he/they see(s) you_{pl}
23. ninakinikonān - he stops us
24. kikakwēcimāwāw - you_{pl} ask him
25. kiwīcihitināwāw - I help you_{pl}

(b) Translate into Plains Cree:
26. if we ask them - kakwēcimāhtāwi (or kakwēcimānāhkāwi)
27. they challenge you_{pl} - kimawinēskomikowāwak
28. they help me - niwīcihikwak
29. you_{sg} see them - kiwāpamāwak
30. I stop you_{pl} - kinakitināwāw

Linguistic Rules for Plains Cree:

    Verb Structure (Transitive Animate - TA): Generally PersonPrefix - VerbStem - PersonSuffixes.

    Personal Prefixes (Independent Order):

        ni-: 1st person involvement (I, we exclusive).

        ki-: 2nd person involvement (you sg, you pl).

        Ø- (no prefix): 3rd person actor if not further specified by suffixes (or if contextually clear).

    Person Suffixes (Independent Order): Complex portmanteau suffixes mark person/number of both subject and object, and transitivity direction (direct/inverse).

        Direct (e.g., 1st/2nd person acting on 3rd): -āw (sg actor -> 3sg obj), -āwak (sg actor -> 3pl obj), -ānān (1pl actor -> 3sg obj), -ānānak (1pl actor -> 3pl obj), -āwāw (2pl actor -> 3sg obj), -āwāwak (2pl actor -> 3pl obj).

        Inverse (e.g., 3rd person acting on 1st/2nd): -ik (3sg actor -> sg obj), -ikwak (3pl actor -> sg obj), -ikonān (3sg actor -> 1pl obj), -ikonānak (3pl actor -> 1pl obj), -ikowāw (3sg actor -> 2pl obj).

        Local (1st/2nd person acting on 1st/2nd): -in (2sg actor -> 1sg obj), -ināwāw (2pl actor -> 1sg obj), -itin (1sg actor -> 2sg obj), -itinān (1pl actor -> 2sg/pl obj, or 2sg/pl actor -> 1pl obj - ambiguous form), ki-...-itināwāw (1sg actor -> 2pl obj).

    Subordinate ("Conjunct") Forms: Used in dependent clauses.

        Participle/Temporal (ē- prefix "as/when"): ē- replaces ni-/ki-. Verb stem is often the same as independent, but suffixes differ (e.g., -ak for 1sgS/3sgO; -ayēk for 2plS/3sgO; -ikoyēk for 3S/2plO). The number of a 3rd person actor may be underspecified.

        Conditional ("if"): Typically no ni-/ki- prefix. The verb stem itself might undergo changes (vowel ablaut or prefix drop). Suffixes are specific to the conjunct conditional mood (e.g., -aci, -ako, -yāhkwāwi). Often ends with a particle like -āwi, -k(o), or -ci.

Problem 5: Supyire Numerals

(a) Write in digits:

    kampwɔhii shuunni na kɛ - 810

    ŋkuu na baataanre - 88

(b) Write out in the Supyire language:

    15 - kɛ na kaŋkuro

    109 - ŋkwuu na beɲjaaga na baaricyɛɛre

    152 - ŋkwuu na beetaanre na kɛ na shuunni

    403 - kampwoo na taanre

    1534 - kampwoo taanre na ŋkwuu sicyɛɛre na kɛ na sicyɛɛre

Linguistic Rules for Supyire Numerals:

    Basic Units (1-5):

        niŋkin (1), shuunni (2), taanre (3), sicyɛɛre / ricyɛɛre / kɛ (4 - allomorphs/contextual uses), kaŋkuro (5).

    Units 6-9: Formed with prefix baa- + unit (1-4):

        baani (6 = 5+1), baashuunni (7 = 5+2), baataanre (8 = 5+3), baaricyɛɛre (9 = 5+4).

    Tens: kɛ (10).

    Higher Units:

        beɲjaaga (20). This can be multiplied by units 1-4 using prefix bee- on the multiplier:

            beeshuunni (40 = 202), beetaanre (60 = 203). ( be(ɲjaaga)niŋkin = 20).

        ŋkwuu (or ŋkuu) (80). Can be multiplied by units 1-4 (e.g., ŋkwuu taanre = 80*3 = 240).

        kampwoo (or kampwɔhii) (400). Can be multiplied by units 1-4 (e.g., kampwɔhii shuunni = 400*2 = 800).

    Structure: Numbers are formed by stringing together these units, generally from largest to smallest value. The particle na ("and") connects different blocks of units.

        If a quantity for a large unit like beɲjaaga, ŋkwuu, or kampwoo is 1, the multiplier word niŋkin may be omitted if the context is clear (e.g., beɲjaaga alone means 20).

        The words for 2, 3, 4 (shuunni, taanre, sicyɛɛre/kɛ) are used as quantity multipliers for ŋkwuu and kampwoo.
