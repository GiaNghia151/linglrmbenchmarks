Problem 1: Ubykh Verb Conjugation Analysis
I'll analyze the structure of the Ubykh verb "to give" based on the provided examples.
Analysis of the Verb Structure
After examining the examples, it's clear that the Ubykh verb for "to give" follows a consistent pattern:

The verb form encodes three participants: the giver (subject), the recipient (indirect object), and the person given (direct object)
The morpheme order seems to be: [Direct Object] - [Indirect Object] - [Subject] - [verb stem]

The morphemes I've identified are:

1st person singular (I/me): s
1st person plural (we/us): šʼ
2nd person singular (you(sg)): wə (as DO/IO), a (as S)
2nd person plural (you(pl)): ŝʷə
3rd person singular (he/him): a (as DO), unmarked (as IO), n (as S)
3rd person plural (they/them): a (as DO), w (as IO), na (as S)

The verb stem varies between "tʷən" and "tʷan" based on patterns in the examples.
(a) Other translation of aŝʷəstʷan
The form aŝʷəstʷan is given as "I give him to you_(pl)". Its other translation would be:
"I give them to you_(pl)"
This is because "a" can mark either "him" or "them" as the direct object.
(b) Translations into English

a: him/them (DO)

P5:

Part (a): What would *bala have become in Tsat?
Looking at sound change patterns from Proto-Chamic to Tsat:

Initial syllable loss: Disyllabic Proto-Chamic words consistently lose their initial syllable in Tsat

*ʔikaːn → kaːn³³, *dilah → la⁵⁵, *jalaːn → laːn¹¹


Tone assignment: Words with final *a in Proto-Chamic typically receive tone 55 when the Proto-Chamic word had *h in final position

*dilah → la⁵⁵, *basah → sa⁵⁵, *lanah → na⁵⁵



Applying these rules to *bala:

It would lose the initial syllable *ba-
The remaining *la would likely receive tone 55

Therefore, *bala would have become la⁵⁵ in Tsat.
Part (b): Filling in the blanks
Sound changes from Proto-Chamic to Phan Rang Cham:

Initial *d → t: *dikiʔ → takiʔ, *dilah → talàh
Initial *b → p: *bara → pirà, *bulow → pilòw
First syllable *a often becomes ɨ: *mata → mɨta, *maray → mɨray
Final *t often becomes ʔ: *labaːt → lipàʔ

Sound changes from Proto-Chamic to Tsat:

Initial syllable loss in disyllabic words
Initial *b → ph: *bara → phia¹¹, *bulow → phiə¹¹
Initial *p → th: *paday → thaːiʔ⁴²
Final *m → nʔ with tone 42: *masam → saːnʔ⁴²
Final *y → iʔ with tone 42: *hatay → taːiʔ⁴²
Final *t → ʔ with tone 24: *ʔurat → zaʔ²⁴
Final *h → tone 55: *dilah → la⁵⁵

Completing the blanks:

*kulit → kaliʔ → liʔ²⁴ (loses initial syllable, final *t → ʔ with tone 24)
*hitam → hatam → tanʔ⁴² (loses initial syllable, final *m → nʔ with tone 42)
*bubah → papàh → pha⁵⁵ (loses initial syllable, *b → ph, final *h gives tone 55)
*ʔikat → ikaʔ (initial *ʔi preserved, final *t → ʔ)
*ʔikat → kaʔ²⁴ (loses initial syllable, final *t → ʔ with tone 24)
*dəpa → təpa (*d → t in Phan Rang Cham)
*dəpa → pa³³ (loses initial syllable, open syllable gets tone 33)
*matay → mɨtày (first syllable *a → ɨ, low tone in second syllable)
*matay → taiʔ⁴² (loses initial syllable, final *y → iʔ with tone 42)
*dalam → talàm (*d → t, low tone in second syllable)
*dalam → lanʔ⁴² (loses initial syllable, final *m → nʔ with tone 42)
*labuh → lipùh (first syllable *a → i, low tone in second syllable)
*labuh → phu⁵⁵ (loses initial syllable, final *h gives tone 55)
*bulaːn → pilòn (*b → p, *u → i, low tone)
*bulaːn → laːn¹¹ (loses initial syllable, tone 11 like *jalaːn → laːn¹¹)
pala → la³³ (loses initial syllable, open syllable gets tone 33)
tapùh → phu⁵⁵ (loses initial syllable, final *h gives tone 55)
tatà → ta³³ (loses initial syllable, open syllable gets tone 33)
