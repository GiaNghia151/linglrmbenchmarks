Solution to Computational Linguistics Problems
Problem 1: Creek Stress Assignment

After analyzing the Creek data, I can identify the following stress patterns:

    When a syllable contains a long vowel (marked with ː) or a falling tone (marked with ˆ), it generally attracts stress.
    In words with no long vowels or falling tones:
        Words with 2-4 syllables typically have stress on the penultimate syllable
        Words with 5+ syllables typically have stress on the antepenultimate syllable

Applying these patterns to the unmarked words:

Creek	        Marked with Stress
[ifa]	        [ífa]
[ifoci]	        [ifóci]
[nâːnaki]	[nâːnaki]
[sâːsakwa]	[sâːsakwa]
[aktopa]	[aktópa]
[hoktaki]	[hoktáki]
[wanayita]	[wanayíta]
[awanayita]	[awanáyita]
[isiskitoci]	[isiskítoci]
[aːtamihoma]	[áːtamihoma]
[honantaːki]	[honantáːki]
[ilitohtaɬita]	[ilitohtáɬita]

Problem 2: Hakhun
(a) Translate into English:

After analyzing the Hakhun sentences, I can identify the following patterns:

    nɤ ʒip ku ne
    "Do you sleep?" or "Are you sleeping?"
    ati kəmə nirum lapkʰi tʰi ne
    "Does he see us?"
    tarum kəmə nuʔrum cʰam ran ne
    "Do they know you(pl)?"
    nirum kəmə tarum lan ki ne
    "Do we beat them?"
    nirum kəmə nɤ cʰam tiʔ ne
    "Do we know you(sg)?"
    nirum ka tiʔ ne
    "Do we go?"

(b) Translate into Hakhun:

    Did I beat you(sg)?
    ŋabə nɤ lan tɤʔ ne
    Did they see me?
    tarum kəmə ŋa lapkʰi tʰu ne
    Does he know you(sg)?
    ati kəmə nɤ cʰam tʰɤ ne
    Do you(pl) sleep?
    nuʔrum ʒip kan ne

Problem 3: Terêna Grammatical Forms
(a) Fill in the gaps:

By analyzing the patterns between 1st and 2nd person forms, I can identify systematic changes:

    Initial consonant changes (mb→p, nd→t, nj→x, ng→k, etc.)
    Vowel changes (often reflecting vowel harmony)
    Dropping of final -m in 1st person forms

The gaps can be filled as follows:

    pîho
    mbîyo
    yêno
    yênom
    kásaxo
    xérere
    teôko
    yeíxoa
    vetéxo
    pómindi
    íhikaxovoku
    ôxum
    nîwom
    áharana

(b) Portuguese borrowings:

    The Portuguese borrowings in Terêna behave differently because they insert an extra vowel (e) after the initial consonant in the 2nd person form, and the initial consonant changes don't follow the exact same patterns as native words.
    Translation:
        my tin can: látana
        my cloak: kápana

Problem 4: Mountain Arapesh Numerals
(a) Missing word X:

The word X is the numeral "1". The linguist thought it was missing in examples 12, 14, and 19 (using the numbering from the original problem).

It's implied by context because in many languages, when counting individual items, the numeral "1" is often omitted as it's understood from context.
(b) Translate into English:

    biabys atub bøbys = 7 betel nuts
    atub juhurub = 3 eggs
    nybat atuh araruh = 4 sugar canes
    biagas atugas biagas baigas = 15 sheets of sago bark
    wiwis baigas = 11 sheets of sago bark

(c) Translate into Mountain Arapesh:

    4 betel nuts = atub bøbys
    11 eggs = wiwis atub juhurubys
    20 eggs = biogu atugu biogu juhurubys
    25 sheets of sago bark = biogu atugu biogu biagas atugas baigas

Problem 5: Akan Family Relations
(a) Family tree with names:

Based on the statements, I can determine:

    Man 1 = Enu, who has children Thema, Yaw, Ama with Woman 2 (Kunto)
    Woman 1 = Nsia
    Woman 3 = Awotwi
    Man 2 = Ofori, who has children Man 6 (Kofi) and Woman 6 (Esi) with Woman 2
    Man 3 = [unnamed]
    Man 4 = Yaw
    Woman 4 = Ama
    Man 5 = Kobina, who is married to Woman 7 (Efua)
    Man 7 = Berko

(b) Fill in the gaps:

    Yɛfrɛ me Yaw. Yɛfrɛ me ɛnanom Kunto. Yɛfrɛ me nuanom Nsia ne Awotwi. Yɛfrɛ me nuanom Thema ne Ama. Yɛfrɛ me wɔfa Awotwi. Yɛfrɛ me wɔfa Ofori. Yɛfrɛ me sewaanom Esi ne Kofi. Yɛfrɛ me wɔfaase Berko.
    Yɛfrɛ me Ofori. Yɛfrɛ me banom Kofi ne Esi. Yɛfrɛ me wɔfaase Yaw ne Ama. Yɛfrɛ me sewaanom Kunto ne Dubaku.
