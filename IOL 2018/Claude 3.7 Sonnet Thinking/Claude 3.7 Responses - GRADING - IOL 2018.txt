Part b:
1:
Classification: Type 2
LLM Answer: These borrowings exhibit a unique vowel infixation pattern after the initial consonant: the first vowel of the Portuguese stem (e.g., a in lapis, lata, capa) is replaced by -amb- in the 1st person singular and by -eá- in the 2nd person singular. They also seem to adopt specific Terena suffixes like -ina or -ana.
Real Answer: In Portuguese loanwords, the vowel á is treated differently: it becomes eá in these loanwords, whereas in native words, á changes to é, and â changes to eâ.

Problem 4:
Part a:
1:
Classification: Type 3
LLM Answer: The word X is araman (or its equivalent biogu atugu biogu), which means "man" and signifies the number 20. Mountain Arapesh uses a base-20 counting system. For numbers greater than 20, the word for "20" is often implied rather than explicitly stated, especially if the context makes the magnitude clear. The linguist initially thought araman was missing in three examples where a number N (less than 20) was stated, but the actual quantity was 20+N. The problem implies these are among the given examples, interpreted as N, but could represent 20+N with araman omitted.
The examples are:
Ex 11: anowip biabys juhurubys (26 eggs). The Arapesh form anowip biabys juhurubys means 6. The word araman (20) is omitted but implied to make 26.
Based on the problem's phrasing, if the list originally had translations like "3 (actually 23)", then the other two could be:
Ex 1 (biaruh atuh araruh, translated as 3): If this expression were used for 23, araman would be implied.
Ex 2 (nybat biabys juhurubys, translated as 6): If this expression were used for 26 (as in Ex 11), araman would be implied.
How it is implied by the context: The total quantity being enumerated (e.g., seeing a pile of 26 eggs) makes it clear that the phrase for '6' is part of '26', so the '20' component is understood.
Real Answer: The word that the linguist initially thought was missing is “sugar canes,” which are represented by the word arah.
The three examples are:

    6 sugar canes — biogu nybat

    10 sugar canes — biogu nybat atuh araruh

    23 sugar canes — biogu atugu biogu biaruh atuh araruh
    In these examples, the term “sugar canes” is implied by context and number markers rather than being explicitly stated.
