**(b) Portuguese borrowings**

These borrowings exhibit a unique vowel infixation pattern after the initial consonant: the first vowel of the Portuguese stem (e.g., a in lapis, lata, capa) is replaced by -amb- in the 1st person singular and by -eá- in the 2nd person singular. They also seem to adopt specific Terena suffixes like -ina or -ana.

Problem 4

(a) The missing word X:
The word X is araman (or its equivalent biogu atugu biogu), which means "man" and signifies the number 20.
Mountain Arapesh uses a base-20 counting system (often related to counting fingers and toes). For numbers greater than 20, the word for "20" is often implied rather than explicitly stated, especially if the context makes the magnitude clear.
The linguist initially thought araman was missing in three examples where a number N (less than 20) was stated, but the actual quantity was 20+N. The problem implies these are among the given examples, interpreted as N, but could represent 20+N with araman omitted.
The examples are:

    Ex 11: anowip biabys juhurubys (26 eggs). The Arapesh form anowip biabys juhurubys means 6. The word araman (20) is omitted but implied to make 26.
    Based on the problem's phrasing, if the list originally had translations like "3 (actually 23)", then the other two could be:

    Ex 1 (biaruh atuh araruh, translated as 3): If this expression were used for 23, araman would be implied.

    Ex 2 (nybat biabys juhurubys, translated as 6): If this expression were used for 26 (as in Ex 11), araman would be implied.

How it is implied by the context: The total quantity being enumerated (e.g., seeing a pile of 26 eggs) makes it clear that the phrase for '6' is part of '26', so the '20' component is understood.

**(b) Translate into English**

| Mountain Arapesh | Translation |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| biabys atub bøbys | Four betel nuts |
| atub juhurub | Two eggs |
| nybat atuh araruh | Seven sugar canes |
| biagas atugas biagas baigas | Five sheets of sago bark |
| wiwis baigas | Twelve sheets of sago bark |

**(c) Translate into Mountain Arapesh**

| English | Mountain Arapesh |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| 4 betel nuts | atub bøbys |
| 11 eggs | wiwis biabys juhurubys |
| 20 eggs | araman juhurubys |
| 25 sheets of sago bark | biogu atugu biogu anowip baigas |

Problem 5

(a) Supply the family tree with names:
The analysis involves identifying individuals and their relationships based on Akan kinship terms, assuming a matrilineal system where a man can marry his father's sister.

    Man 1 (M1): Ofori

    Woman 1 (W1): Dubaku

    Woman 2 (W2): Kunto

    Ofori (M1) is married to an unnamed woman (NanaAma, not on this tree).

    Children of Ofori (M1) and NanaAma:

        Man 2 (M2): Enu

        Man 3 (M3): Nsia

        Woman 3 (W3): Awotwi

        Woman 4 (W4): (Name not given in provided texts)

        Man 4 (M4): Kwabena (hypothetical name for filling blanks, actual name not given)

    Dubaku (W1) is married to an unnamed man.

        Child of Dubaku (W1): Man 5 (M5): Kobina (His siblings Yaw1, Ama1 are not on this tree diagram).

        Man 5 (Kobina) marries Woman 6 (W6): Efua.

    Kunto (W2) marries Man 2 (Enu). (Enu marries his father's sister).

        Children of Kunto (W2) and Enu (M2):

            Man 6 (M6): Yaw (referred to as Yaw2 in thought process)

            Woman 5 (W5): Ama (referred to as Ama2 in thought process)

            (Their sibling Thema is not shown on this tree diagram).

    Woman 3 (Awotwi) has one child:

        Man 7 (M7): Berko

    Kofi and Esi are children of YM (an unlisted sister of Ofori, Dubaku, Kunto) and M4/Kwabena (Ofori's son, who married his father's sister YM). They are not directly on this tree structure but related.

(b) Fill in the gaps:

    Speaker: M4/Kwabena (Man 4, son of Ofori).

        Yɛfrɛ me Kwabena. (Using a placeholder name for M4).

        Yɛfrɛ me banom Kofi ne Esi. (My children Kofi and Esi. M4/Kwabena is married to YM, his father's sister and mother of Kofi/Esi).
